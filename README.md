This is a simple add-on for Firefox/Android which adds an API allowing
whitelisted webpages to broadcast Intents.  We use this to allow webapps
to interact with the [funf](http://funf.org) data collection framework.

More information on the OLPC Literacy project using this add-on can
be found on the [OLPC wiki](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Literacy_Project).
